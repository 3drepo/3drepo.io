              cancellation right:</strong> If you are registered to use the Service as a consumer, you have up to 14
            days from the date on which we confirm our acceptance of your registration (the “cancellation period”),
            to cancel your Subscription with us and your receipt of the Services, without giving any reason. You may
            do this by completing the model cancellation form set out at the end of these Terms of Use and sending it
            to us at support@3drepo.org. We will reimburse payments received from you no later than 14 days after
            receipt of your cancellation notification. However you acknowledge that, by logging in to use the Service
            within the cancellation period, you are expressly requesting that we begin the provision of the Service
            to you. In that case, you agree that you will pay for the Service received during the period up to your
            cancellation.</p>

          <p>All Users may end their Subscription (or other access as a User) at any time by
            notifying us using the relevant section of the Service (please note that the terms of any contract
            between us and your business will determine your business' access to the Service, irrespective of your
            status as a User). Your Subscription and any other right to receive the Service will end at the end of
            the then-current Subscription period. However, you acknowledge that, where you are ending your
            Subscription without cause, you will not receive any refund of Charges already paid in advance in
            relation to the remainder of the relevant Subscription period. Furthermore, if for any reason at the date
            of termination you owe us any Charges, we will take payment for such sums via our chosen payment
            processor, or issue an invoice to you for payment.</p>

            we still reserve the right to temporarily suspend an account until such time as the issue is resolved
            with the User. This is for security reasons. During a breach we would not want to keep the system
            vulnerable by waiting for the User to respond.The responses described above are not limited and we may
            take any other action we reasonably deem appropriate.</p>

        <li>

            after the date on which the Subscription ends. Therefore we advise that any Submitted Content required
            after the Subscription ceases is exported prior to that date.</p>
