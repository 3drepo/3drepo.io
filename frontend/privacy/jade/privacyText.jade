	span(style='font-size: xx-small;')
		// At the moment we use Rackspace and host exclusively in their datacentres in the UK. Even if we used AWS, we would go with their Dublin-based datacentre. The difficulty with these things is that any public construction in the UK has to host data on British soil, so I would avoid mentioning destinations outside EEA if not outside UK altogether.
p
	| All Data you provide to us is stored on secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology by our payment processing partner. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password or an API key which enables you to access the Service, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.

Although we will do our best to protect Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your Data transmitted to us; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your Data, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
