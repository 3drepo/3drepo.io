				<h2>How is your personal data shared?</h2>
				<p>We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out
					in the table in paragraph 4 above.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Amazon servers in London or Canada, depending on your user specified preference.</p>

						<p>Paypal, Google Cloud and Dropbox or other similar support service provider.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or

							a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the
							same way as set out in this privacy notice.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in
					accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data
					for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes
					and in accordance with our instructions.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2>International transfers</h2>
				<p>To support our business functions, we need to send your personal data to companies that may have
					servers based outside the EEA.
				</p>
				<p>One of our hosting companies is located in Canada which you can opt to use for your account. This
					hosting company is based in a country that has been deemed to provide an adequate level of
					protection for personal data by the European Commission. You do not have to choose this Canada
					hosting option and you are free to choose another UK hosting company if you prefer.
				</p>
				<p>Where we use certain other service providers (such as Google Cloud, Paypal and Dropbox), we may use
					specific contracts approved by the European Commission, which give personal data the same
					protection it has in Europe.
				</p>
				<p>Please contact us at  if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when
					transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2>Data security</h2>
				<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being
					accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition,
					we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third
					parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our
					instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
				</p>
				<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you
					and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2>Data retention</h2>
				<h3>How long will you use my personal data for?</h3>
				<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we
					collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or
					reporting requirements.
				</p>
				<p>As regards all personal data, we aim to hold this for no longer than 10 years and in respect
					of the personal data obtained through our consumer accounts, we delete all such personal
					data from our records 7 days following the closure of your account
					with us.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2>Your legal rights</h2>
				<p>You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner&apos;s
					Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk).
					We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns about
					data protection before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance.

					This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not
					disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask

				<h3>Time limit to respond</h3>
				<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us
