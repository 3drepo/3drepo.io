# 3drepo.io ![](https://travis-ci.org/3drepo/3drepo.io.svg?branch=master)

3drepo.io a web based BIM collaboration platform. It is one of the 4 parts of the 3D Repo ecosystem.

## Latest Release & API
* Latest release: https://github.com/3drepo/3drepo.io/releases/tag/latest
* Corresponding API docs: https://3drepo.github.io/3drepo.io/

## Dependencies

* Node.js (v 8.11.3)
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

## Setting up your 3D Repo environment
To setup the whole 3D Repo Ecosystem, you will need the following:
- A running MongoDB database, with an admin user created;
- A RabbitMQ server;
- A running Bouncer Worker service, provided in [3drepobouncer](https://github.com/3drepo/3drepobouncer).

Note: To generate viewable 3D models, you will need 3drepounity to create asset bundles. **This is a closed source project**. Please contact sales@3drepo.org for a business license, alternatively you can use 3drepo.io version v1.12 which uses the old x3dom rendering engine.

##Installation

Note: If using windows, please ensure cmd.exe was invoked as administrator (i.e. Right click -> Run as Administrator).

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/3drepo/3drepo.io.git`
2. Change directory: `cd 3drepo.io`
3. Check out latest release: `git checkout tags/latest`
5. Setup the configuration file for running the 3D Repo web app as per the `Configuration` section below.
6. Install the required backend dependencies: `cd backend && yarn install`
7. Install the required frontend dependencies: `cd frontend && yarn install`
8. Compile the frontend: `cd frontend && yarn run build` (for file watching/live reloading, see `Running the application` below)

Configuration
-------------

The configuration files are contained in the `config` folder. Each directory in config represents a different configuration. This allows you to quickly switch between, for example, a development environment and a production environment. Each configuration folder is expected to have a config.js file, which details the configuration settings for the particular environment.

In general, to configure a new configuration enviroment called <config_name>:
 
1. Change to the configuration directory: `cd config`
2. First create a new directory under config: `mkdir <config_name>`
3. Copy config/sample_config.js to the new directory as config.js: `cp config_sample.js <config_name>/config.js`
4. Edit config.js as described in [Configuration File](https://github.com/3drepo/3drepo.io/wiki/Configuration-File)

Running the application
-----------------------

The repository includes a script `run_app` and `run_app.cmd` specifically for Windows to run the server. It has two arguments:

**./run/run_app \<config\> \<debug\>**
* **config** This is the directory under config that the configuration resides in
* **debug** Type debug here for node.js debugging, or leave it out for none.
  
Typically you will want to run the server using pm2 (install with `npm -g install pm2` under the superuser account):

**./run_app_pm2 \<config\>**
* **config** This is the directory under config that the configuration resides in

### File Watching & Live Reloading

All frontend files are observed and automatically re-compiled if you run `yarn run watch`.

For live reloading, set `development: true` in your `config.js`.

## Locally running the application

The application requires the use of cookies for tracking user authentication. Some browsers do not
allow the use of cookies for the `localhost` domain. To circumvent this problem, please use the loopback address (127.0.0.1) as your domain name.

Alternatively you can modify your hosts file to add a DNS entry to your loopback address. For Windows, you must use an Administrator notepad to edit the file:

`C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`

For Linux, you must edit the file with Administrator privileges:

`sudo nano /etc/hosts`

Within this file you must append to, or create, a line for the entry for example:

`127.0.0.1 localhost example.org`

In the configuration file for the server, you then set hostname to `example.org` or whatever host you have redirected.
