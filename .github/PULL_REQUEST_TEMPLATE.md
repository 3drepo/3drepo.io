This fixes #<!-- Enter issue number here -->

<!-- Add a high level description of the changes made (possibly quite similar to task list if it was a feature) 
e.g.
- Support new error codes
- Changed wording of some error codes
- Removed unused error codes
- Replaced some error codes that are irrelevant to user (e.g. if bouncer failed to launch, we shouldn't tell the user about it, it should just tell them the process failed)
- Add bouncer error code to email notification for better referencing.
- Changed some response codes from 500 to 400 (e.g. user uploading a file with no mesh is a user error, not system's)
