<!-- BUG(S) REPORT TEMPLATE (delete as appropriate) -->
<!-- Label this issue as "bug" -->

### Description
<!-- Brief description of the bug -->
Highlighting objects on a federation node that would highlight multiple sub models is not functioning.

- This is happening in: prod/staging/both <!-- note: if this only happens on a ISSUE-*.dev.3drepo.io, you should be posting this bug on the respective PR -->
- This requires a hotfix to production: yes/no <!-- this should always be a no unless you have product manager's approval -->

### Steps to replicate
- Open this model: `a link to the model`
- click on the root node of a federated tree

### Current Behaviour
- Only one of the models was highlighted.

### Expected Behaviour
- All models should be highlighted
