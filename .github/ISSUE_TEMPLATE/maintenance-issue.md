### Description
<!-- Describe the painpoint or the problem you have -->
<!-- e.g There are too much duplicated code between the container routes file and the federation routes file, adding a new route or modifying an existing route contains a lot of copy and pasting which is prone to error -->

### Suggested solution
<!-- Describe contextually or in deals what you would like to fix -->
<!-- e.g. we should refactor those routes into a common file with boolean flags to indicate which model type it should be -->

### Goal
<!-- The goal you're setting out to achieve -->
<!-- e.g. - [ ] Any common routes between federation and container should be merged -->
<!-- e.g. - [ ] Any special routes that are exclusive to federation/container should still be separated -->
<!-- e.g. - [ ] All routes should still work as before -->

### Tasks
<!-- Identify the tasks that needs to be done to achieve your goal -->
<!-- e.g. - [ ] merge all containers/federation routes -->
<!-- e.g. - [ ] merge all containers/federation e2e tests -->
